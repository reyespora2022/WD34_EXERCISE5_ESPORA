        <h2> Culture</h2>
             <p> To showcase the rich culture and history of Borongan City, the City Government will hold an Arts Week on June 1-5, 2022 as part of the 2022 Charter Month Celebration.
              This event aims to encourage and support the Boronganon art community by providing them a venue to showcase their artwork and participate in tourism development.
              Public and private schools, non-government organizations, and civil society groups are invited to plan and register visual arts activities for children and families. 
              <br>
              <br>These activities give children, young people, and even senior citizens together with their families and friends, the opportunity to take part in multiple art activities with professional artists. The activity will culminate with a painting of the 2-km long seawall of Baybay Boulevard.</p>
                  </p>
   <h2> Workshop</h2>
        <p>Interested groups and individuals are encouraged to join the art workshop headlined by artists well-known for their large outdoor murals. This is led by AG Sano along with Richard Sandigan and Joy Abutan.</p>
        <p>AG Sa√±o is a Filipino muralist, conservationist, photographer, landscape architect, and environmental activist best known for numerous prominent advocacy murals along main thoroughfares around Metro Manila.</p>
